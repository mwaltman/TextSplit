# TextSplit
TextSplit is a program that displays text slides and allows users to set global hotkeys to navigate slides. 

# Features
- Text font, text color, background color and margins are customizable in the layout.
- Hotkeys for navigating to the next, previous, first and last slides can be customized. Hotkeys are global, meaning the program will respond even when TextSplit is not in focus.
- Each slideshow, including its layout, is stored in a single .tst file. Multiple .tst files can be opened in separate windows.
- Supports importing from txt files, where a delimiter string is used to divide the txt file into separate slides. Also supports saving to txt files. Automated importing and exporting is possible with the sync functionality.
